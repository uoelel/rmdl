## Introduction

::: callout-warning
When working through these tutorials, **make sure you are in the course Quarto Project** you created.

You know you are in a Quarto Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.

If you see `Project (none)` in the top-right corner, that means **you are not** in a Quarto Project.

To make sure you are in the Quarto project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the `.Rproj` file.

In this tutorial you will run a Bayesian model with the data from Martin 2020 (DOI [10.1177/0956797620931108](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620931108)).
