It is just there to mark that those are folders.)\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, **make sure you are in the course Quarto/RStudio Project** you created.\n\nYou know you are in a Quarto Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.\n\nIf you see `Project (none)` in the top-right corner, that means **you are not** in a Quarto Project.\n\nTo make sure you are in the Quarto project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the `.Rproj` file.\n:::\n\nIn this tutorial, you have to run Bayesian regression models with data from Winter 2012 (DOI [10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006)).\n\nYou can get the data [here](/data/winter2012/polite.csv) (right-click and download). This page explains the meaning of the columns in the data: <https://uoelel.github.io/qml-data/data/winter2012/polite.html>.\n\n## Mean f0\n\nFit a regression model to answer the following question:\n\n> Do the months spent in Germany modulate the effect of attitude on mean f0?\n\nThe model should have the following variables:\n\n-   `f0mn` as the outcome variable.\n-   `gender`, `months_ger` and `attitude` as predictors. Use indexing (`0 +`).\n-   Add varying effects as needed.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolite <- read_csv(\"data/winter2012/polite.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 224 Columns: 27\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (6): subject, gender, birthplace, musicstudent, task, attitude\ndbl (21): months_ger, scenario, total_duration, articulation_rate, f0mn, f0s...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe fit a Bayesian regression model with mean f0 as the outcome variable, using a Gaussian family.
