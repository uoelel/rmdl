It is just there to mark that those are folders.)\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, **make sure you are in the course Quarto/RStudio Project** you created.\n\nYou know you are in a Quarto Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.\n\nIf you see `Project (none)` in the top-right corner, that means **you are not** in a Quarto Project.\n\nTo make sure you are in the Quarto project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the `.Rproj` file.\n:::\n\nIn this tutorial, you have to run Bayesian regression models with data from Winter 2012 (DOI [10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006)).\n\nYou can get the data [here](/data/winter2012/polite.csv) (right-click and download). This page explains the meaning of the columns in the data: <https://uoelel.github.io/qml-data/data/winter2012/polite.html>.\n\n## Mean f0\n\nFit a regression model to answer the following question:\n\n> Do the months spent in Germany modulate the effect of attitude on mean f0?\n\nThe model should have the following variables:\n\n- `f0mn` as the outcome variable.\n- `gender`, `months_ger` and `attitude` as predictors. Use indexing (`0 +`).\n- Add multilevel effects as needed.\n\n## H1-H2 difference\n\nIf you have time, run another regression model to answer the following research question:\n\n> Does being a music student modulate the effect of attitude on the H1-H2 difference?\n\nThe H1-H2 difference is correlated with breathiness: the higher the difference, the more breathy the voice quality.\n\n## Reporting\n\nIt is unusual to report the results of the varying effects (not that this is necessarily a good practice), but you should at least mention the varying effects you included when reporting the model specification. For example, if the model has `(A | participant)`:\n\n> As multilevel (aka random) effects, I included by-participant varying intercepts and by-participant varying slopes for A.\n",
