It is just there to mark that those are folders.)\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, **make sure you are in the course Quarto/RStudio Project** you created.\n\nYou know you are in a Quarto Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.\n\nIf you see `Project (none)` in the top-right corner, that means **you are not** in a Quarto Project.\n\nTo make sure you are in the Quarto project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the `.Rproj` file.\n:::\n\nFor this tutorial you have to run a Bayesian model with data from Winter 2012 (DOI [10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006)).\n\nYou can get the data [here](/data/winter2012/polite.csv) (right-click and download). This page explains the meaning of the columns in the data: <https://uoelel.github.io/qml-data/data/winter2012/polite.html>.\n\n## Mean f0\n\nFit a regression model to answer the following question:\n\n> Do the months spent in Germany modulate the effect of attitude on mean f0?\n\nThe model should have the following variables:\n\n- `f0mn` as the outcome variable.\n- `gender`, `musicstudent`, `months_ger` and `attitude` as predictors.\n- Two-way interactions between `attitude` and each of the other predictors (don't include 3/4-way interactions since there is probably not enough data to estimate those robustly).\n- Add group-level intercepts as needed.\n\n## H1-H2 difference\n\nIf you have time, run the same model but now with the H1-H2 difference `H1H2` as the outcome variable (the H1-H2 difference is correlated with breathiness: the higher the difference, the more breathy the voice quality).\n\nNow answer the following question: **Does being a music student modulate the effect of attitude on the H1-H2 difference?**\n",
