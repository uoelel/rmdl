You can get the data by downloading the [zip file](data.zip) with all the data from this course. The Martin 2020 data is in `martin2020/data_anonymized`. The file `martin2020/data_anonymized/README.txt` contains information on the columns found in the data. You will have to bind the English and Kîîtharaka data.\n\nFilter the data to have only \"post-pre\" trials (`trial_type`) and address the following research question:\n\n> Do both English and Kîîtharaka show a preference for post-changed items (i.e. greater accuracy) in both conditions (words and shapes)?\n\n\n\n",
