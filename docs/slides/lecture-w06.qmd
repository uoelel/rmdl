::: box-note
-   Data from [Song 2020](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000170).

-   Shallow morphological representation in L2 speakers.

-   **Lexical decision task**: Is the word a real English word or not?

-   **Priming paradigm**:

    -   **Prime**: *prolong* (unrelated), *unkind* (constituent), *kindness* (non-constituent).

    -   **Target**: *unkindness* (*\[un-kind\]-ness*, not *un-\[kind-ness\]*).

-   English L1 and English L2/Cantonese L1 participants.

## Song 2020: hypotheses

::: box-warning
Vague hypothesis:

> The Shallow Structure Hypothesis (SSH) allows the possibility for nonnative speakers to show strong priming effects from nonconstituent and constituent primes equally because the shallow processing route, which relies more heavily on semantic and surface-level information than on structural information.

## Results overview

::: box-note
> The Shallow Structure Hypothesis (SSH) allows the possibility for nonnative speakers to show strong priming effects from nonconstituent and constituent primes equally because the shallow processing route, which relies more heavily on semantic and surface-level information than on structural information.

-   The 90% CrI of the difference between nonconstituent and constituent in L2 is \[-1.3, 0.26\].

-   At 70% probability, the log-odds of the priming effect on accuracy between nonconstituent and constituent in L2 participants differs between -0.98 and -0.01.

-   There is a lot of uncertainty in the expected predictions of individual participants, although there is a tendency for negative differences between nonconstituent and constituent.
:::

## Summary

::: box-tip
-   You should include varying terms if data is "hierarchical", for example repeated measures from participants or items.

-   Not including varying terms (wrongly) inflates posterior certainty.

-   Frequentist regression models with lme4 often don't converge and researchers simplify the hierarchical structure of the model.
