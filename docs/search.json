Run the following in the Console.\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nThe cmdstanr package is an interface between R and CmdStan (see below), while brms is the package you will use to run Bayesian linear models (think of it as the Bayesian equivalent of lme4).\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf at any point you get asked about installing extra packages or software or update existing packages or software, please do so. In all cases, carefully read the message in the Console or in a pop-up window: they always tell you what to do or the options you have.\n\n\n2.3 Install CmdStan\nNow that you have installed the R packages, you need to install CmdStan.\nCmdStan is a shell interface to the programming language Stan.\nStan is what runs the Bayesian models, but you don’t have to know Stan, because you will use the R packages to run the models (those packages will communicate with Stan in your stead).\nTo install CmdStan, run the following command in the R console:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = parallel::detectCores(), overwrite = TRUE)\nIt will take several minutes and you will see a lot of text flashing in the Console.\n\n\n2.4 Check your installation\nRun the following in the RStudio Console.\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nfile &lt;- file.path(cmdstan_path(), \"examples\", \"bernoulli\", \"bernoulli.stan\")\nmod &lt;- cmdstan_model(file, force_recompile = TRUE)\ndata_list &lt;- list(N = 10, y = c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))\nfit &lt;- mod$sample(\n  data = data_list, \n  seed = 123, \n  chains = 4, \n  parallel_chains = 4,\n  refresh = 500 # print update every 500 iters\n)\nIf everything goes well you should see Compiling Stan program… and then Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains… followed by information on chains and iterations."
